    "Step 1:Define a class called Contact to represent a single contact.Include attribute such as name and phone to store the contact's details. Implement the _str_ method to provide a string representation of the contact.\n",

Split each line into name and phone using the comma separator, create a contact object, and append it to a list of contacts.finally,return the list of contacts.\n",
    "Step 3:Create a function called save_contacts that takes a file name and a list of contacts as input.Inside the function, open the file in write mode and iterate over the contacts.Write each contacts name and phone to the file in the format\"Name,Phone\".\n",

If the names are out of order,swap the contacts.Repeat this process until the list is sorted in ascending order.\n",

Iterste over the list starting from the second contact.Compare each contacts name with the contacts before it ans shift them to the right until the correct position is found. Insert the contact into the correct position in the sorted part of the list.\n",

Iterate over the list and find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted part of the list.swap the minimum element with the current element to place it in the correct position.\n",
